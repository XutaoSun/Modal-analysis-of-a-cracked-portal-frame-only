MATLAB code for a cracked portal frame (natural frequency and mode shape calculation)
This MALTAB code file calculates the natural frequency and mode shape of a cracked portal frame. The dynamic stiffness method is used. The Wittrick-Williams algorithm is enployed to search for natrual frequencies. The crack lies in the middle member of the portal frame. Timoshenko beam theory and Rayleigh bar theory are combined.
